    <p class="id">
      Birds are warm-blooded, feathered animals found worldwide, known for their
      ability to fly, though some species, like penguins and ostriches, are
      flightless. They have lightweight skeletons, beaks instead of teeth, and
      lay hard-shelled eggs. Birds communicate through songs and calls and play
      vital roles in ecosystems, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Their
      diets vary widely, including seeds, insects, and small animals.
