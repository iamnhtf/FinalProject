    <p class="id">
      Deer are graceful, herbivorous mammals found on every continent except
      Antarctica and Australia. They are known for their antlers, which males
      shed and regrow annually, and their coats, which often change color with
      the seasons for camouflage. Deer thrive in diverse habitats like forests,
      grasslands, and mountains, and they are most active during dawn and dusk.
      Living in herds for safety, they feed on plants, leaves, and fruits,
      playing a vital role in their ecosystems.
