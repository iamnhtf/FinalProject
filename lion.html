    <p class="id">
      Lions are powerful carnivorous mammals known as the "king of the jungle."
      They live in groups called prides, mainly in African savannas and
      grasslands. Males are recognized by their majestic manes, while females
      are the primary hunters. Lions are apex predators, feeding on large
      animals like zebras and buffalo. Their roars can be heard up to 5 miles
      away, marking their territory and communicating with their pride.
